## Description 
This is a note application that allows the user to write, save & delete notes, using express.js GET, POST & DELETE requests. Using the starter code provided for the front-end of the application, I built the back-end to connect the two. This application is deployed & hosted by Heroku.

## Usage 
To begin using the application, the user must open the application using the link above in the installation section. Upon opening the webpage, the user will see the app's homepage. By clicking "Get Started", the user will see previous notes in the sidebar, as well as a blank note, with a sections titled "Note Title", and "Note Text". To start create a new note, the user can click on these sections and begin typing. If they want to save what they've written, they can click the save button in the top right corner, or if they don't want to save and would like to start a new note, they can click the plus sign in the top right corner. 

To see previous notes, click on a note title in the sidebar on the left side of the screen. If the user would like to delete a saved note, they can click the trash can next to the note title.

To return to the homepage, click the words "Note Taker" in the top left corner of the screen and the user will be brought back to the homepage.
